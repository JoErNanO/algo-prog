Here are some basic test for this solution.
In order to make the test compile, you have to:
- make methods contains/correcte/... as public methods
- add two new methods:

public int[] getValues() {
  return this.elements;
}

public void setValues(int height, int[] values)
  this.hauteur = height;
  this.elements = values;
}
